               Early birds earn better grades in school: In 2008, a study was conducted at Texas University in which people identified themselves as "morning people" or "night owls." It was found that those who identified as early risers, on average, earn a full point more in their GPA than night owls (3.5 GPA vs. 2.5 GPA).

                    Early risers are more proactive: Christopher Randle, a Harvard psychologist proved that morning people are more likely to identify and set long-term goals for themselves. The study also found that these same early risers are more likely to believe that they're in charge of actually making their goals come to fruition.

                        Better at anticipating problems: Morning risers are better at anticipating problems and solving them efficiently and quickly than others.

                        Optimism is enhanced: There have been multiple studies conducted that show that morning people more often exhibit traits like optimism, agreeability, satisfaction, and conscientiousness. Although "night owls" often exhibit traits like intelligence and creativity, they're also more likely to be depressed, neurotic and pessimistic.

                        Enhanced ability to organize in work and life: Studies have proven that people who wake up early in the morning are better at planning, both in the short term and long term.

                        Take better care of themselves: As logical as it is, there is research behind the fact that morning risers inevitably have more time to exercise and take care of themselves mentally, emotionally and physically before the day starts. The same research conclusively shows that this has the effect of boosting their energy and productivity for the day.

                        Get better sleep: If you can consistently wake up early, you're more likely to be able to go to bed at a reasonable hour. The better sleep is also a product of exerting more energy throughout the day due to a longer day.
